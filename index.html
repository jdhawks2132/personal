                <p id="aboutBody">I am a Music Educator turned Software Engineer. In addition to teaching band, I was also the Vice President of Marketing and Director of Educational Outreach for Bocal Majority (a music company that specializes in double-reed camps, instruments, and supplies). While with Bocal Majority, I was deeply involved in a massive re-branding effort that included website design (landing page for the camps, and an e-commerce site), logo design, print/ social media campaigns and trade show appearances. I have also done free-lance design work for local musicians, band programs, medical offices, and political campaigns.</p>

                <p id="bio2txt">  Outside of writing code, I enjoy playing the bassoon, photography, graphic design, and writing ghost stories. My husband, Jessie, and I don't have any pets but a few of our house plants are still living despite our best efforts.We play "recreational" softball with The Dallas Thunder Kitties. Even though it is just for fun, we have been very successful and play hard. In addition to our sportsball endeavors, we are both avid gamers. Favorites are FFXIV, WoW, Overwatch, any and all Zelda titles, and Paper Mario/ Mario Galaxy.</p>
